# Nvim configuration files

I use this config mainly for:

- Programming under git versionning (PHP/JS/HTML/CSS/Python/Bash)
- Text/Mail editing

note that \ is not leader in this configuration (, is) and ;, has been moved
to < >, taking advantage of bepo (see bepoptimist plugin)

I used http://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html post to help me organize
and used a few settings/functions suggested.


I also used some of Doug Ireton mirror pond settings

Thank you to all the people behind the plugins I used, it’s awesome!

Dependencies:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- vim-plug:   https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
- git:        for vim-fugitive plugin (optionnal)
- jshint:     for syntastic — npm install -g jshint (optionnal)

Installation:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

copy this file to ~/.vimrc for vim or ~/.local/nvim/init.vim for neovim
manually install vim-plug as instructed
I don't maintain vim version anymore so you will have to modify some code
to make it work.

Tip: Setting your keyboard key repeat and speed high will give you a better
experince in vim!
